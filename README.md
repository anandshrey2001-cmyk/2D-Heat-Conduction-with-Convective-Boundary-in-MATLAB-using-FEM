2D steady State Heat Conduction with Convective Boundary
Extended the FEM model to include convective boundary conditions
• Used a fine mesh ( 100 elements) and a central point heat source (1kW)
• Compared temperature contours and centerline profiles with previous Dirichlet case
• Analyzed thermal gradients near boundaries to assess convection effects
